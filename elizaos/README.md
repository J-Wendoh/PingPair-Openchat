# PingPair ElizaOS Integration Demo

This directory contains a simplified demonstration of how ElizaOS concepts can enhance PingPair bot functionality.

## Overview

The demo shows how ElizaOS features would improve PingPair in several key areas:

1. **Enhanced Conversations**: More natural, context-aware responses
2. **Improved Matching**: Better pairing based on interests and communication style
3. **Cultural Knowledge**: Richer information about countries and traditions
4. **Personalized Experience**: Adapts to each user's preferences and interests

## Files

- `pingpair-eliza-demo.js`: Standalone JavaScript demo that doesn't require dependencies
- `pingpair.character.json`: Character configuration that defines PingPair's behavior
- `setup.sh`: Script to set up the demo environment

## Running the Demo

```bash
# First, run the setup script
bash setup.sh

# Then run the demo
node pingpair-eliza-demo.js
```

## Demo Functionality

The demo simulates:

1. **Character-Driven Behavior**: Using the defined character configuration
2. **User Matching**: Creating matches with country spotlights
3. **Cultural Information**: Providing detailed information about countries
4. **Natural Responses**: Demonstrating more conversational interactions

## Next Steps

For a full implementation of ElizaOS integration:

1. Install the complete ElizaOS framework
2. Implement actual providers and actions using the ElizaOS API
3. Connect to the PingPair core functionality
4. Add advanced features like contextual memory and personalization

See `../docs/dev-notes.md` for the complete integration approach.
