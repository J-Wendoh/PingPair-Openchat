You earn Strix points for participating and completing meetups, especially with people from different continents. Use \`/pingpair stats\` to check your points and match history anytime!"`);

// Conclusion
console.log("\n\n=== ELIZA INTEGRATION BENEFITS ===");
console.log(`
1. Enhanced Conversations: More natural, context-aware responses
2. Improved Matching Algorithm: Better pairing based on interests and communication style
3. Cultural Knowledge Base: Richer information about countries and traditions
4. Personalized Experience: Adapts to each user's preferences and interests
