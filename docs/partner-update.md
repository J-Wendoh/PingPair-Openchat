# PingPair Bot: Project Update

Dear Partner,

We're excited to update you on our progress with PingPair, our submission for the OpenChat Botathon in the "Social & Community" category.

## Project Overview

We're building PingPair, a social bot that connects people globally through themed, twice-weekly meetups. The bot aims to foster cross-cultural understanding and create an engaged community of globally-minded individuals.

## Core Functionality

- **Global Spotlights**: Every 3-4 days, users receive a "Ping Time" message highlighting a different country with cultural facts
- **Interest-Based Matching**: Users are matched based on shared interests in exploring different cultures
- **AI-Generated Profiles**: Brief snapshots of match information to facilitate conversation
- **Video Chat**: Temporary links for real-time connection
- **Strix Points**: A network value system that grows with each completed connection

## Current Progress

- âœ… Project initialized with OpenChat Bot SDK
- âœ… Basic structure and command handling implemented
- ðŸŸ¡ Core functionality implementation in progress
- ðŸŸ¡ User profile system under development
- ðŸŸ¡ Matching algorithm being designed

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of all command handlers
2. Implement the matching algorithm
3. Test the bot's functionality thoroughly
4. Deploy to the OpenChat platform
5. Create promotional materials for launch

## Timeline

We're working within a tight 2-hour implementation window for the initial proof of concept, with plans to expand the functionality post-submission.

## How You Can Help

- Review our pitch deck and provide feedback
- Test the bot once we have the initial version deployed
- Share ideas for country spotlights and cultural content
- Help with marketing and promotion after launch

We're excited about the potential of PingPair to create meaningful global connections and appreciate your support in bringing this vision to life!

Regards,
The PingPair Team
