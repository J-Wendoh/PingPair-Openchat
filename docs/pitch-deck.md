# PingPair: Global Connections Made Easy

## The Problem

In our increasingly connected world, we still struggle to form meaningful connections with people from different cultures and backgrounds. Existing platforms either:
- Focus on dating rather than friendship
- Lack cultural context for connections
- Don't provide structured interaction prompts
- Fail to incentivize ongoing community participation

## Our Solution: PingPair

PingPair is a social AI bot that helps people meet others from around the world through themed, twice-weekly connection prompts.

### How It Works

1. **Global Spotlights**: Every 3-4 days, users receive a "Ping Time" notification highlighting a country with fun facts and cultural insights
2. **Interest-Based Matching**: Users are matched with someone who shares their interest in exploring the spotlighted culture
3. **AI-Generated Profiles**: See a brief snapshot of your match's interests, skills, and background
4. **Seamless Video Chat**: Connect through a temporary video chat link to have a real conversation
5. **Reward System**: Earn "Strix" points for completing connections, building your global network value

### Key Features

- **Flexible Participation**: Join the connections you're interested in, skip the rest
