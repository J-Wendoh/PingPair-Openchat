# Development Notes

## ElizaOS Integration

ElizaOS is being integrated into the PingPair bot to enhance its capabilities and provide a more autonomous agent-based approach. This integration involves:

1. **Character Configuration**: Using `pingpair.character.json` to define the bot's personality, capabilities, and behavior.
2. **Cultural Provider**: Implementing a custom provider that supplies cultural information for matching.
3. **Match Action**: Creating a specialized action handler for the matching process.
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Leveraging the Internet Computer (IC) network for decentralized hosting.

### Implementation Details

- The ElizaOS integration exists in the `elizaos/` directory
- Character file is defined with core actions and plugins
- Custom providers enhance the bot's knowledge and capabilities
- Actions handle specific functionality, such as matching and cultural exchange

## Architecture Overview

The PingPair bot is built with a modular architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and real-time performance:

1. **Server Layer**: Express.js server handling requests, webhooks, and API endpoints
2. **Command Handlers**: Processing user commands and routing to appropriate services
3. **Services Layer**: Core business logic for matching, user management, and features
4. **Data Layer**: In-memory data structures for user information, matches, and state

## Data Structures

### User Object
```javascript
{
  id: String,          // Unique identifier
  name: String,        // Display name
  timezone: String,    // User's timezone
  interests: [String], // Array of interests
  country: String,     // User's country
  stats: {
    matches: Number,   // Total matches
    streaks: Number,   // Current streak
    points: Number     // Strix Points
  },
  status: String,      // "active", "paused", "matched"
  achievements: [      // Earned achievements
    {
      id: String,      // Achievement ID
      name: String,    // Display name
      date: Date       // Date earned
    }
  ],
  currentMatch: String // ID of current match (if any)
}
```

### Match Object
```javascript
{
  id: String,           // Unique identifier
  users: [String],      // Array of user IDs
  startDate: Date,      // When match was created
  endDate: Date,        // When match expires
  status: String,       // "active", "completed", "skipped"
  compatibilityScore: Number, // Match quality score
  interests: [String]   // Shared interests
}
```

### Announcement Object
```javascript
{
  id: String,           // Unique identifier
  authorId: String,     // User ID of author
  title: String,        // Announcement title
  content: String,      // Announcement content
  timestamp: Date,      // Creation time
  reactions: {          // User reactions
    [reactionType]: [String] // Array of user IDs
  },
  comments: [           // User comments
    {
      id: String,       // Comment ID
      userId: String,   // Commenter's ID
      content: String,  // Comment text
      timestamp: Date   // Comment time
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Decisions

### Matching Algorithm
1. **Timezone Compatibility**: Users within 3 hours are preferred
2. **Interest Matching**: More shared interests increase compatibility
3. **Cultural Compatibility**: Different countries earn bonus points
4. **Streaks**: Active streak users get priority matching

### Achievement System
1. **Progression Tracking**: Based on match counts, streaks, and points
2. **Badge Assignment**: Automatic based on milestones
3. **Level System**: Points determine user levels
4. **Streak Monitoring**: Track consecutive days of activity

### ElizaOS Integration
1. **Character Setup**: Customized character file for PingPair bot
2. **Custom Providers**: Cultural provider for enriched matching data
3. **Action Handlers**: Match action to handle pairing users
4. **Deployment**: Integration with OpenChat via ElizaOS

### Blockchain News Integration
1. **API Integration**: Multiple sources for comprehensive coverage
2. **Country Filtering**: News relevant to specific regions
3. **Digest Compilation**: Daily summaries of major developments
4. **Quiz Generation**: Interactive questions from news content

### Announcements Feature
1. **Creation Logic**: Users earn points for quality announcements
2. **Comment System**: Nested comments with point rewards
3. **Reaction System**: Multiple reaction types that earn points
4. **Sorting Algorithm**: Combines recency and engagement metrics

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Management**: Efficient data structures to minimize footprint
2. **Response Time**: Optimized matching algorithm for quick responses
3. **Scalability**: Modular design to handle more users and features
4. **Caching**: Frequently accessed data stored for quick retrieval
5. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic during peak usage

## Security Measures

1. **User Data**: Minimal personal information collected
2. **Data Protection**: Securely stored and not shared with third parties
3. **API Security**: Input validation and rate limiting
4. **Command Validation**: Prevent malicious inputs and commands
