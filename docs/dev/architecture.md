# System Architecture

## Overview

PingPair Bot is built with a modular architecture focusing on scalability, maintainability, and real-time performance. The system is designed to handle user matching, social features, and blockchain news integration.

## Core Components

### 1. Server Layer
- Express.js server
- Webhook handler
- API endpoints
- Schema management
- CORS handling

### 2. Command Handlers
- Core commands (start, profile, skip)
- Social features (announcements, achievements)
- Blockchain news features
- Command validation and routing

### 3. Services Layer
- Matching algorithm
- User management
- Achievement system
- Blockchain news service
- Announcement system

### 4. Data Layer
- In-memory storage
- User data structures
- Match tracking
- Achievement tracking
- Announcement storage

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**
   ```
   User -> OpenChat -> Webhook -> Command Handler -> Service Layer -> Response
   ```

2. **Matching Process**
   ```
   User Request -> Matching Service -> Algorithm -> Match Creation -> Notification
   ```

3. **Announcement Flow**
   ```
   Create -> Storage -> Distribution -> Reactions/Comments -> Updates
   ```

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Matching Algorithm
- Timezone compatibility
- Interest matching
- Cultural compatibility
- Streak bonuses
- Time-based bonuses

### 2. Point System
- Match completion: 10 points
- Streak maintenance: 5 points/day
- Announcement creation: 5 points
- Comment addition: 2 points
- News reading: 3 points
- Quiz completion: 5 points

### 3. Achievement System
- Progress tracking
- Badge assignment
- Level progression
- Streak monitoring

## Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**
   - Command sanitization
   - User input validation
   - Rate limiting

2. **Data Protection**
   - In-memory storage
   - No sensitive data
   - OpenChat authentication

3. **API Security**
   - CORS configuration
   - Rate limiting
   - Error handling

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Management**

   - Regular cleanup
   - Cache optimization

2. **Response Time**
   - Quick command processing
   - Efficient matching
   - Cached responses

3. **Scalability**
   - Modular design
   - Service separation
   - Stateless operations

## Integration Points

### 1. OpenChat Integration
- Webhook handling
- Schema management
- Command processing
- Response formatting

### 2. Blockchain News
- News aggregation
- Country-specific data
- Quiz generation
- Daily digest

### 3. Community Features
